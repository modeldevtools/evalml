    "[Dask](https://dask.org/) is a parallel computing library for Python. One of the major benefits of using Dask is the ability to scale up computation from a local laptop all the way to a cluster. As such, it is currently the preferred method accelerating the EvalML search process.  \n",

    "Through the use of the Engines API, EvalML provides the ability to scale out the pipeline search to multiple workers. For more information about the Engines API and how to create your own engine, see the documentation. \n",

    "## Quick Start Example\n",
    "The easiest way to enable EvalML to evalute pipelines locally is to create a new `DaskEngine`. By default, this will create a local Dask cluster with 4 workers. "
